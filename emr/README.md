## Script structure
The scripts in this folder are adapted from dp_tools experimentation scripts which contains parameterised inputs.
In your data pipelines or experimentations, you might want to adopt a more focused approach by coding the `datasets`, `column name` , and `query` inline with `epsilon` parameterised to control the privacy budget.
